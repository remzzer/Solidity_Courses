// The uint data type is an unsigned integer, meaning its value must be non-negative
// There's also an int data type for signed integers

//Note: In Solidity, uint is actually an alias for uint256, a 256-bit unsigned integer.
//You can declare uints with less bits - uint8, uint16, uint32, etc...
//In general you simply want to ue uint except in specific cases

contract learnConversions {

//What's an unsigned int:
//  uint defaults uint256
//  min value of 0
//  max value of 2^256-1  = 1.15792089Ã—10^77
  uint number;

//Conversion to smaller type costs higher order bits.

  uint32 d = uint32(c); // d = 0x00001234 | 4 bits were added

// What is the cost?

//Conversion to smaller type costs higher order data
  bytes1 f = bytes1(e); // f = 0x12
