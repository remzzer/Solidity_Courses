/*
Inheritance is a way to extend functionality of a contract.
Solidity supports both single as well as multiple inheritance. Following are the key highlights.

Constructor - A special function declared with constructor keyword
which will be executed one per contract and is invoked when a contract is created.

  Exercise Create two contracts A and B
  1. Contract A should have a state var called innerVal initialized to 100.
  2. Create a fully accessible function called innerAddTen which returns 10 to any given input
  3. Contract B should inherit from contract A
  4. Contract B should have a function called outerAddTen which returns the calculation from innerAddTen function
  in Contract A to any given input
  5. Create a function in contract B which returns the value of innerVal from contract A.

*/


contract A {
  uint innerVal = 100;

  function innerAddTen(uint n) public pure returns(uint){
    return n + 10;
  }
}

contract B is A {
  function outerAddTen() public pure returns (uint){
     return innerAddTen(1);
  }

  function getInnerVal() public view returns (uint){
      return innerVal;
  }
}
